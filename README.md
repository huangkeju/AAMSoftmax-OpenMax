# AAMSoftmax-OpenMax for open set authentication of IoTs with limited devices
Softmax, ASoftmax and AAMSoftmax are used as loss functions to train the feature extractor respectively.

OvA and OpenMax are the classifiers for open set authentication.

For each combination of loss function and classifier, run main.py first to train the network and then run main_test.py for testing.

The ADS-B dataset for evaluation (adsb-107loaded_2.mat) is available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/1bxc-ke87.
